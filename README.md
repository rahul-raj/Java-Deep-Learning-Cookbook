# Java Deep Learning Cookbook

This is a code repository for the upcoming book "Java Deep Learning cookbook" sponsored by Packt Publishing. We use and promote **deeplearning4j** library for all use-cases in this book. 

**Update**

ETA for the cookbook release is extended to October 2019
Chapter-wise readme sections will be updated accordingly. 

# Build

Each chapter will have separate source folder where all examples are stored for the particular chapter. For example, if you want to import the code for chapter 2, navigate to the chapter directory first and then import the directory **sourceCode/cookbook-app** in your IDE. You should also see pom.xml located there.

   ## From Intellij IDE

 - Navigate to the sourceCode root directory.
 - Open as a Maven project and compile.


## From Command Line
    mvn clean install

If you face issues with Intellij being not able to detect dependencies or any workspace issues,
try running the below command:

   
    mvn idea:idea

Delete ***workspace.xml*** under ***.idea*** directory if problem persists.
